# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub

I'm **Davidson Oliveira**, a **BI & Analytics Consultant** with 7+ years of hands-on experience, working at the intersection of **Business Intelligence, Data Engineering, and Applied AI**.

I don’t build demos.  
I build **solutions that run in production**, support decision-making, automate operations, and generate revenue.

## 🚀 What I Build

End-to-end data and AI solutions — from raw data to decision, from manual process to automation.

### 🧠 Selected Projects & Real Use Cases
